# Welcome to My Tinkering World!

This blog is a collection of my personal projects and experiments—where I dive into everything from CNC machining, 3D printing, IoT, electronics, programming, and web development. It's my way of documenting and sharing the fun, challenges, and insights that come with hands-on tinkering.

A bit about me: I’m a mechanical engineer by education and a data wrangler by trade, but at my core, I’ve always been a tinkerer. My experience across various industries within the manufacturing sector ignited my passion for exploring new technologies and building things just for the joy of it.

Whether it's prototyping with a 3D printer, automating with IoT, or creating web applications, this platform serves as a repository for all the projects and lessons learned along the way. My hope is that by sharing my journey, I can connect with like-minded enthusiasts and inspire others to start tinkering, experimenting, and creating.

Thanks for visiting!
